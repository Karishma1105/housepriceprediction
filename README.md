## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python and the following libraries installed:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Running the Prediction

```bash
python predict_house_prices.py
```

### Example Usage

```python
from house_price_predictor import HousePricePredictor

# Create an instance of the predictor
predictor = HousePricePredictor()

# Make a prediction
prediction = predictor.predict_price(square_footage=2000, bedrooms=3, location='Example City')

print(f'Predicted house price: ${prediction}')
```

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is stored in the `data` directory. It includes information on house prices and relevant features.

## Model Training

The machine learning model is trained using the `train_model.py` script. You can adjust hyperparameters and model architecture in this file.

```bash
python train_model.py
```

## Evaluation

The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.

```bash
python evaluate_model.py
```

## Results

The model achieved the following performance metrics:

- Mean Absolute Error: X
- Mean Squared Error: Y
- R-squared: Z
